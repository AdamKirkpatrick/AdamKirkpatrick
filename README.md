### Hello,

My name is Adam Kirkpatrick and I am a student (sophmore) at Windsor High School.

I am interested in working in electrical engineering or computer programming in the future.
I currently am fairly new to this field of study as I have only taken one intro course.
I am excited to learn more about Robotics and Coding in the future via Rassberry Pi or Arduino platforms.
A fun fact about me is that I run Cross Country.
